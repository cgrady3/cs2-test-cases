# CS2 Test Cases
This repository contains student-made test cases for Professor Szumlanski's programming assignments from his Spring 2021 Computer Science 2 course.

**It's strongly recommended that you create and run your own test cases first!** Only after you've thought about edge cases on your own should you use the test cases housed here or add your own to the pile. Doing so will not only help everyone else to make sure their submission is thorough, but also challenge you and help you grow by considering or coding up other cases. 

To contribute test cases of your own:
1. Fork this repo and clone the fork into a directory
2. Place your own test case(s) and input/output file(s) into it, adhering to folder structure
3. Commit and push those changes to your fork, making sure not to overwrite any files that were already there (if you are overwriting anything, let someone know why!)
5. I'll review the new branch and merge it with master as long as the files you upload don't contain any solution code/hints or anything malicious.

To use these test cases:
1. Clone this repo into a directory
2. Move/copy into the directory your solution source code, as well as the test case source files and sample output text files provided by Prof. Szumlanski, adhering to folder structure
3. Follow the instructions laid out in the assignment PDF to test your solution against the cases, either with the test cases individually or with a modified test-all script.

Testing any or all of these cases on Eustis isn't particularly advised, since some of the test cases might involve input files too large to upload on Eustis.
