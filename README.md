# CS2 Test Cases
This repository contains student-made test cases for Professor Szumlanski's programming assignments from his Spring 2021 Computer Science 2 course.

To use these test cases:
1. Clone this repo into a directory
2. Move/copy into the directory your solution source code, as well as the test case source files and sample output text files provided by Prof. Szumlanski, adhering to folder structure
3. Follow the instructions in the assignment PDF(s) to test your solution against the cases

Testing on Eustis isn't particularly advised, since some of the test cases may involve input files too large to upload on Eustis.
