# CS2 Test Cases
This repository contains student-made test cases for Professor Szumlanski's programming assignments from his Spring 2021 Computer Science 2 course.

To use these test cases:
1. Clone this repo into a directory
2. Move/copy into the directory your solution source code, as well as the test case source files and sample output text files provided by Prof. Szumlanski, adhering to folder structure
3. Follow the instructions laid out in the assignment PDF to test your solution against the cases.

To contribute test cases of your own:
1. Fork this repo and clone the fork into a directory
2. Place your own test case(s) and input/output file(s) into it, adhering to folder structure
3. Commit and push those changes to make a pull request, making sure not to overwrite any files that were already there
4. I'll review the pull request and let it go through if the files you upload don't contain any solution code or anything malicious.

Testing any or all of these cases on Eustis isn't particularly advised, since some of the test cases might involve input files too large to upload on Eustis.
